$ cd BooGroCha/cmd/bgc

```

### [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/boogrocha)

## Usage

### Book a room
Allows for booking rooms by showing the available rooms for the given date and time.

```bash
$ bgc book <date> <time>
```
* **\<date\>** can be either an absolute date (`YYYYMMDD`, `YYMMDD`) or a relative date (`MMDD`, `DD`, `D`, `today`, `tomorrow`, `monday`, `tuesday` ...)
* **\<time\>** can be either (`HH:mm-HH:mm`, `HH-HH`, `H-H`, `H-HH`, `HH-H`) or aliases like `lunch`

The `book` sub-command also takes the following optional flags:
* `--cid <cid>` to perform the book request with a specified cid
* `--campus <campus>` or `-c <campus>` to filter the available rooms by a specified campus. (Valid campuses are `J`, `Johanneberg`, `L` and `Lindholmen`. Note that these values are not case-sensitive)
* `--size <size>` or `-s <size>` to filter the available rooms by size and will only show the rooms that are big enough. (When a size is specified the list of available rooms will also show the capacity of each room)
* `--room <room>` or `-r <room>` to try to book a specified room (the name of the room is case-insensitive) instead of letting you choose one interactively from the list of available rooms.
* `--message <message>` or `-m <message>` to add a specific message to the booking instead of asking for it interactively.

### List booked rooms

```bash
$ bgc list
```

### Delete booked rooms

```bash
$ bgc delete
```

### Configuration
Allows the user to set parameters in a config file.

#### Setting a variable
```bash
$ bgc config set <variable> <value>
```
* **\<variable\>** can for example be `cid` or `pass`
* **\<value\>** should be the value that you want to set the variable to (NOTE: when setting the password you will be prompted for input instead of setting it directly)

#### Clearing a variable
```bash
$ bgc config clear <variable>
```
* **\<variable\>** can for example be `cid` or `pass`

#### Showing a variable
```bash
$ bgc config get <variable>
```
* **\<variable\>** can for example be `cid` or `campus` (NOTE: You cannot show the `pass` variable this way)
